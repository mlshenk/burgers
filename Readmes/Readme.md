## Description
This assignment was to create an interactive burger app using MySQL, ORM, Handlebars, and Express servers. A MySQL database was created first, then connected to an express server to add, update, and save information entered into the database. The deployed app presents the user with three different burger types and categorizes them depending on whether they had been eaten or not. The left side displays the burgers that have not been devoured. Devoured burgers are displayed on the right side. Burgers on either side have a button that will move the burger from one side of the screen to the other based on 'devoured status.' The input field on the bottom of the page allows the user to create a new type of burger and designate whether or not it has yet been devoured. All of the backend functionality and server transfers were created/connected via ORM, then linked into handlebars HTML to deploy the website.
